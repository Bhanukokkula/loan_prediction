 Loan Prediction System

## Overview
This project aims to build a loan prediction system that predicts whether a loan application should be approved or denied based on various features. The prediction system utilizes machine learning classification algorithms to assess the risk associated with a loan application.

## Features
- **Data Source:** The dataset used for this project contains information about loan applicants, including personal details, financial history, and other relevant attributes.

- **Algorithms:**
  - **Logistic Regression:** Used for binary classification to predict loan approval or denial.
  
  - **Decision Tree:** A decision tree model is employed to make predictions based on features such as income, credit score, and debt-to-income ratio.

  - **Random Forest:** Utilizing an ensemble of decision trees for more robust predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages can be installed using:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Data
- **loan_data.csv:** The dataset containing information about loan applicants.

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation:**
 - Ensure the dataset is in the correct format and includes all necessary features.
 - Handle any missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature scaling.

2. **Training:**
 - Run the `train_logistic_regression.py`, `train_decision_tree.py`, and `train_random_forest.py` scripts to train the respective models on the prepared dataset.

3. **Prediction:**
 - Use the trained models to make predictions on new loan applications by running the `predict.py` script.

## Files
- **loan_data.csv:** Sample dataset containing loan applicant information.
- **train_logistic_regression.py:** Script for training the Logistic Regression model.
- **train_decision_tree.py:** Script for training the Decision Tree model.
- **train_random_forest.py:** Script for training the Random Forest model.
- **predict.py:** Script for making predictions using the trained models.
- **requirements.txt:** List of Python packages required for the project.

## Results
- Provide insights into the accuracy and performance of each model.
- Include any relevant visualizations or metrics to demonstrate the effectiveness of the predictions.

## Evaluation
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Future Work
- Discuss potential improvements or enhancements that can be made to the models.
- Consider experimenting with hyperparameter tuning, exploring other classification algorithms, or incorporating additional features.
